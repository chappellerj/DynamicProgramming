# DynamicProgramming
Project that takes a text file that has no spaces as an input, and outputs all possibilities in ranked order of likelihood to a separate text file. 
This project uses dynamic programming to do so, and uses additional data from a list of most likely words to rank the possibilities.
All code is in C++.
